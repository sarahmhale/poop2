      <h1>Hi, I'm Sarah</h1>
      <p>Raised in the flames of late-century Flint, MI, I vowed to fight ugly interfaces and battle confusion in all forms. I love JQuery, open access to information, and subversively educational video game At work, I drive UI requirements from concept to release. I define features, user flows, content & error conditions.My goal is to ship funny, beautiful experiences.</p>
